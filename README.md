# War-Game
Implementation of the classic card game 'War'

## Requirements 

Deck of 52 cards to be created, shuffled & divided evenly between two players.
In each round, both players play a card from their collection.
The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and collects both cards.
If the played cards have the same rank, a war is initiated:
Each player plays three additional cards face-down.
Each player then plays another card face-up.
The player with the higher-ranked face-up card wins the war and collects all the cards played in that round.
If there is another tie, the war continues with additional rounds until a winner is determined.
The game continues until one of the players runs out of cards.
The player with more cards in their collection at the end of the game is declared the winner.
